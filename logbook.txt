20141016:
Worked a bit on GameFrame.hpp, the thing that initializes subsystems.

20141024:
Finished GameFrame.hpp. Tinkered a bit with log.hpp. Settled on ERROR, DEBUG,
WARNING, INFO, TRACE logging calls. Also added a NullBuffer and Nullstream
class, acts like /dev/null. Don't instantiate them, just use the global
nullstream instance. Also added an exit() function to the statemachine,
manually changing to the exit state is a lot of typework.

20141025:
Worked on Settings.hpp. Edited logger to use a conditional instead of a null
device. That way the compiler will optimize the debug loggings away.

20141026:
Added a function chopLeft(). Haven't worked on it yet. Scratch that, just
finished chopLeft() and chopRight(). They just break a string in two. Added
stringhelpersfuncs toInt, toFloat and toString. And removed them, seems that
they are in the stl since C++11! Seems that Settings.hpp is finished. Removed
the possibility to set settings, since it might (not) preserve markup of the
file. And the getInt, getFloat functions use exceptions! stoi not supported by
32bit MinGW??? Unbelievable. Fuck this, I'm writing my own str <-> float,int
functions!!!!!!111! Done. And Settings.hpp now also works, after fixing a
dealbreaking bug. I really should do some testing and documentation soon.
Altough documentation doesn't really matter since I don't have any
autocomplete in here. Testing is important though.

20141031:
Updated todolist. Updated it some more. Changed a lot of dates to YYYY-MM-DD.
This should be default everywhere. Tried to get CombineHeadersIntoParent.py to
work for all header modules. Tup is still whining about 64-bit executables.
Have to try of cmd.exe can start in 32-bit mode.
