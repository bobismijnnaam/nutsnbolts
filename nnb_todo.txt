+ testing!
	+ catch framework
	+ Especially game state machine, lol
+ Change all file description dates to YYYY-MM-DD. Done at some places but not
all.
+ Random facilities
	+ thread safe/unsafe flavours
+ Something that allows resolution-independent development
	+ Likely together with ECS?
+ Debug facilities for standard structures (sdl_point, vector, etc)
+ ECS
+ Make nnb::Text
	+ Add multiline support (should just work by doing nnb::Text::enableMultiline(true)
+ Make nnb::getFiles() accept no file extension, and a list of extension (varargs?)
	+ Add a newline in the error debug output of nnb::getFiles()
+ Custom cursor sdl wrapper
+ I don't like the subsystems class or something. Seems way to weird and
overengineered.
+ StateMachine
	+ Some default transitions, and some default loading screens
+ Make a class that loads a standard JSON at runtime, from which you can
extract values like g_vars.int("varname"), or g_vars.str("varname") or
something
+ Make CMake gobble up all the headers 'n stuff
