+ StateMachine
	+ fixed timestep variations
	+ SimpleGameState (or any other non-nnb::GameState class) should catch quit event from SDL
+ testing!
	+ catch framework
	+ Especially game state machine, lol
+ Text, TextureContainer
	+ Nadenken over clone method, die compleet individuele kopie maakt met
	zelfde settings enzo
+ Change all file description dates to YYYY-MM-DD. Done at some places but not
all.
+ Make cbt able to add gamestates!
+ Owning texture container (just a std::unique_ptr typedef?). 
	+ Do we really need this?
+ Give nnb::Text an imitate()/shallowclone() function to copy all settings from another
	+ But with his own texture ofcourse
+ Renderstack, keeps track of rendertargets and can push/pop rendertargets
	+ Not sure if this is needed
+ What if an object that is initialized using an initializer list needs a
texture loaded in the constructor. When the object is initialized the texture
group is not yet loaded!
	+ Oplossing: Wanneer een afbeelding van een groep voor het eerst geladen wordt, rest van
	groep ook laden
	+ probably won't be a problem if you have inbetween loading screens. Not
	that my loader supports that.
+ nnb::intersectOrWithin voor rects (!SDL_IntersectRect(&world, &bulletShape,
			&interRect) && SDL_RectEmpty(&interRect)))
+ A class which can be a member on top of another class which loads texture
groups and stuff
	+ Can be a useful alternative if you don't want to load everything upfront
	or don't want to have inbetween loading screens. Is probably nice to have for
	jams and stuff
+ Make nnb::chopLeft return tuples (right also)
